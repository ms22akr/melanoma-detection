melanoma detection
The detection of melanoma, which is the most aggressive type of skin cancer, remains an
enduring challenge in the medical field. While early detection can significantly improve patient
outcome and survival rates, most traditional diagnostic methods would depend on visual
examinations and invasive biopsies, which can be often subjective, tedious, and resource-
intensive (Esteva et al., 2017). This project aimed at harnessing advances in deep learning to
create another reliable and non-invasive method for diagnosing melanoma via dermoscopic
images. The idea is to incorporate state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) like
VGG19 and EfficientNetB7 to enhance the body of knowledge in AI-powered medical
diagnostics. (Haenssle et al., 2018).
Detection of melanoma applying artificial intelligence is interested in recent studies because of
its potential to change cancer diagnosis. The increased availability of abundantly annotated data
sets and advances in deep learning architecture marks this site, which witnessed significant
progress in recent years. This chapter reviews existing studies that use AI technologies to detect
skin cancer and specifically melanoma and critically examines their contributions. The goal is to
explore the strengths and weaknesses of previous research, identify the gap, and justify the
methodology adopted for the present.
